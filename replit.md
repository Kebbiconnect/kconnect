### UI/UX Decisions
The platform adopts a mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and Alpine.js for interactivity. It incorporates KPN's official colors (Green, White, Blue) and includes a dark mode toggle. Navigation features a professional bar with the KPN logo and a mobile menu.

### Technical Implementations
Built on Django 5.2.7, the system is modularized into `core`, `staff`, `leadership`, `campaigns`, `donations`, `media`, and `events` applications. It features a custom `User` model with a role-based authentication and authorization system supporting 41 leadership roles across State, Zonal, LGA, and Ward tiers, each with distinct dashboards and permissions. Registration includes dynamic cascading dropdowns for location, real-time vacancy checking, gender collection, and mandatory Facebook page follow verification, enforcing strict seat limits.
