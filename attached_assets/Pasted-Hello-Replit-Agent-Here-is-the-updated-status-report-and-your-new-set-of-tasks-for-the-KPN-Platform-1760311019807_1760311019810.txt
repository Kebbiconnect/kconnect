Hello Replit Agent. Here is the updated status report and your new set of tasks for the KPN Platform. Excellent progress has been made, and the platform is now approximately 65% complete.

Several core systems (Events, Financials, Media) are now 100% functional. Your new mission is to implement the remaining critical features that are currently blocking full organizational functionality.

I have created and placed three comprehensive review documents in the `docs/reviews/` folder for your reference: `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, `ROLE_BY_ROLE_ANALYSIS.md`, and `ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_COMPLETE.md`.

Here is the summary of your next set of requirements.

### **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES (YOUR IMMEDIATE FOCUS)**

The following three systems are the highest priority blockers. The entire platform's core purpose cannot be fulfilled until these are implemented.

**1. Hierarchical Reporting System - CRITICAL**
*   **Specification Requirement:** A reporting chain from Ward â†’ LGA â†’ Zonal â†’ State levels.
*   **Current Status:** The `Report` model exists, but there is **NO** submission or review workflow.
*   **What's Missing:**
    *   Report submission forms for all subordinate levels (Ward, LGA, Zonal).
    *   Logic for hierarchical routing (reports must go to the correct supervisor).
    *   A review/approval interface for supervisors.
    *   Status tracking (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected) and deadline management.
*   **Impact:** This is the backbone of organizational accountability. Without it, there is no oversight.

**2. Member Mobilization Tools - CRITICAL**
*   **Specification Requirement:** The Director of Mobilization must be able to filter members by location/role to generate contact lists for campaigns.
*   **Current Status:** 0% implemented.
*   **What's Missing:**
    *   A user interface for filtering the member database.
    *   Advanced segmentation filters (by Zone, LGA, Ward, Role, Gender, etc.).
    *   Functionality to generate and export contact lists (CSV/Excel).
*   **Impact:** The core mobilization mission of the organization cannot be executed. This is a primary function.

**3. Gender Field & Women's Programs - BLOCKING**
*   **Specification Requirement:** The Women Leader must be able to view, manage, and create programs for female members only.
*   **Current Status:** The `User` model has **NO GENDER FIELD**.
*   **What's Missing:**
    *   A `gender` field needs to be added to the database model.
    *   The ability for the Women Leader's dashboard to filter and display only female members.
    *   Tools for planning and tracking participation in women's programs.
*   **Impact:** This completely blocks the entire Women's Program pillar of the organization.
