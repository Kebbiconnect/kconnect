## Critical Bug Found & Fixed

### üêõ Bug #1: President Dashboard Crash
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Description:**  
President dashboard was crashing when loading donation statistics due to two issues: incorrect field reference in database query and missing import statement.

**Error Details:**
```
FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'verification_status' into field. 
Choices are: amount, created_at, donor_name, donor_phone, id, status, ...
```

**Root Cause:**  
Two separate issues in `staff/views.py`:

1. **Lines 394-395:** Incorrect field name in query:
   ```python
   # INCORRECT
   total_donations = Donation.objects.filter(verification_status='VERIFIED').aggregate(Sum('amount'))
   ```
   The correct field name in the Donation model is `status`, not `verification_status`.

2. **Line 6:** Missing import for `Sum` function:
   ```python
   # INCOMPLETE
   from django.db.models import Q
   ```
   The `Sum` function needed for aggregation was not imported.

**Complete Fix Applied:**
1. Changed field name from `verification_status` to `status` (lines 394-395)
2. Added `Sum` to imports (line 6):
   ```python
   from django.db.models import Q, Sum
   ```

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loads successfully (HTTP 200)
- ‚úÖ No FieldError
- ‚úÖ No ImportError
- ‚úÖ Donation statistics display correctly

**Impact:** Dashboard now fully operational with correct donation statistics.
