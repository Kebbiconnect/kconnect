```

---

    gender = models.CharField(
        max_length=1,
        choices=[('M', 'Male'), ('F', 'Female')],

    )

```

---

### 5. Legal Oversight Integration ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

def approve_disciplinary_action(request, action_id):
    # Current: Only State President
    # New: Legal Adviser can review first
    
    if request.user.role_definition.title == 'Legal & Ethics Adviser':
        # Legal review step
        action.legal_opinion = request.POST['opinion']
        action.legal_reviewed = True
        action.save()
        # Then President approves
    elif request.user.role == 'STATE':
        # Final approval
        
# Add fields:
legal_reviewed = BooleanField()
legal_opinion = TextField()
