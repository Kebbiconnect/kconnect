# KPN Platform - Hierarchical Report Workflow Documentation
## Complete End-to-End Report Submission and Review System

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0 (Fully Functional)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## üéØ OVERVIEW

The KPN Platform now has a **fully functional hierarchical reporting system** that automatically escalates reports through the organizational chain:

**Ward ‚Üí LGA ‚Üí Zonal ‚Üí State**

This document provides complete details on how the system works, from submission to final review.

---

## üìä SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **1. Report Model Enhancements**

#### **New Fields Added:**
```python
parent_report = ForeignKey('self')         # Links to parent report in the chain
is_escalated = BooleanField()              # Tracks if report was escalated
escalated_at = DateTimeField()             # When escalation occurred
```

#### **New Status:**
- `ESCALATED` - Report approved and escalated to next level

#### **Helper Methods:**
- `get_report_chain()` - Returns full chain from root to current report
- `can_be_escalated()` - Checks if report is eligible for escalation

---

## üîÑ COMPLETE WORKFLOW

### **Step 1: Ward Secretary Submits Report**

**Who:** Ward Secretary (or any Ward leader with `role='WARD'`)  
**To:** LGA Coordinator

**Process:**
1. Ward leader logs in and navigates to "Submit Report"
2. Fills out the report form:
   - Title (e.g., "Ward Weekly Report - Week 1")
   - Period (e.g., "January 2025", "Week 1")
   - Content (detailed report text)
   - Deadline (optional)
3. Clicks "Submit Report"

**What Happens:**
```python
# System automatically:
- Identifies the LGA Coordinator for the Ward's LGA
- Creates report with report_type='WARD_TO_LGA'
- Sets status='SUBMITTED'
- Records submitted_at timestamp
- Sets submitted_to=LGA_Coordinator
- Sends email notification to LGA Coordinator
```

**Notification Sent To:** LGA Coordinator
- Subject: "New Report Submitted: [Title]"
- Contains: Title, Period, Submitted by, Deadline

---

### **Step 2: LGA Coordinator Reviews Ward Report**

**Who:** LGA Coordinator  
**Action:** Reviews the Ward report

**Process:**
1. LGA Coordinator receives email notification
2. Logs in to dashboard
3. Navigates to "View Reports"
4. Sees report in "Pending" tab (filter_status=pending)
5. Clicks on report to review
6. Reviews content and makes decision:
   - **APPROVE** ‚Üí Escalates to Zonal
   - **FLAG** ‚Üí Marks for issues, sends back to Ward
   - **REJECT** ‚Üí Rejects report

**Dashboard Statistics Shown:**
- Pending Reports: Count of unreviewed reports
- Reviewed Reports: Count of reviewed reports
- Approved: Count of approved reports
- Flagged: Count of flagged reports
- Rejected: Count of rejected reports
- Escalated: Count of escalated reports
- Overdue: Count of overdue reports

---

### **Step 3A: LGA Coordinator APPROVES (Automatic Escalation)**

**What Happens When APPROVED:**
```python
# System automatically:
1. Marks Ward report as status='ESCALATED'
2. Sets is_escalated=True
3. Records escalated_at timestamp

4. Creates NEW report:
   - title = "Consolidated Ward to LGA Report - [period]"
   - report_type = 'LGA_TO_ZONAL'
   - content = "[Escalated from LGA Coordinator]\n\n[original content]"
   - submitted_by = LGA_Coordinator
   - submitted_to = Zonal_Coordinator
   - parent_report = original_Ward_report
   - status = 'SUBMITTED'
   - submitted_at = now()

5. Sends two notifications:
   - To Ward Secretary: "Report APPROVED"
   - To Zonal Coordinator: "New Report Submitted"
```

**Success Message Shown:**
> "Report approved and escalated to [Zonal Coordinator Name]!"

---

### **Step 3B: LGA Coordinator FLAGS or REJECTS**

**What Happens When FLAGGED:**
```python
# System:
- Sets status='FLAGGED'
- Saves review_notes
- Sends notification to Ward Secretary
- Does NOT escalate
```

**Notification to Ward Secretary:**
- Subject: "Report FLAGGED: [Title]"
- Contains: Status, Reviewed by, Review notes

**What Happens When REJECTED:**
```python
# System:
- Sets status='REJECTED'
- Saves review_notes
- Sends notification to Ward Secretary
- Does NOT escalate
```

---

### **Step 4: Zonal Coordinator Reviews LGA Report**

**Who:** Zonal Coordinator  
**Action:** Reviews the escalated LGA report

**Process:**
1. Zonal Coordinator receives email notification
2. Logs in to dashboard
3. Sees the escalated report from LGA
4. Reviews report content (includes original Ward report)
5. Makes decision:
   - **APPROVE** ‚Üí Escalates to State Supervisor
   - **FLAG** ‚Üí Marks for issues, sends back to LGA
   - **REJECT** ‚Üí Rejects report

**Report Content Shows:**
```
[Escalated from John Doe - LGA Coordinator]

[Original Ward report content here]
```

**Parent Report Link:**
The system tracks that this LGA report came from the Ward report via `parent_report` field.

---

### **Step 5: Zonal Coordinator APPROVES (Final Escalation)**

**What Happens When APPROVED:**
```python
# System automatically:
1. Marks LGA report as status='ESCALATED'
2. Sets is_escalated=True
3. Records escalated_at timestamp

4. Creates NEW report:
   - title = "Consolidated LGA to Zonal Report - [period]"
   - report_type = 'ZONAL_TO_STATE'
   - content = "[Escalated from Zonal Coordinator]\n\n[LGA report content]"
   - submitted_by = Zonal_Coordinator
   - submitted_to = State_Supervisor
   - parent_report = LGA_report
   - status = 'SUBMITTED'
   - submitted_at = now()

5. Sends notifications:
   - To LGA Coordinator: "Report APPROVED"
   - To State Supervisor: "New Report Submitted"
```

---

### **Step 6: State Supervisor Final Review**

**Who:** State Supervisor (or President)  
**Action:** Final review of the report chain

**Process:**
1. State Supervisor receives email notification
2. Logs in to dashboard
3. Reviews the Zonal report
4. Can see the full report chain:
   - Original Ward report
   - LGA escalation
   - Zonal escalation
   - Current State report
5. Makes final decision:
   - **APPROVE** ‚Üí Marks as approved (NO further escalation)
   - **FLAG** ‚Üí Marks for issues
   - **REJECT** ‚Üí Rejects report

**What Happens When APPROVED:**
```python
# System:
- Sets status='APPROVED'
- Sets is_reviewed=True
- Records reviewed_by=State_Supervisor
- Records reviewed_at timestamp
- Sends notification to Zonal Coordinator
- Does NOT escalate (end of chain)
```

**Special Note:** ZONAL_TO_STATE reports do NOT escalate further.

---

## üîç DASHBOARD FEATURES

### **View Reports Dashboard**

**URL:** `/staff/view-reports/`  
**Access:** All approved leaders (Ward, LGA, Zonal, State)

#### **Dashboard Statistics:**
```python
- Total Reports: All reports submitted to user
- Pending: Reports awaiting review (status=SUBMITTED, is_reviewed=False)
- Reviewed: All reviewed reports
- Approved: Reports approved
- Flagged: Reports flagged for issues
- Rejected: Reports rejected
- Escalated: Reports escalated to next level
- Overdue: Reports past deadline
```

#### **Filter Options:**
- `?status=all` - Show all reports
- `?status=pending` - Show only pending reports
- `?status=reviewed` - Show only reviewed reports
- `?status=approved` - Show only approved reports
- `?status=flagged` - Show only flagged reports
- `?status=rejected` - Show only rejected reports
- `?status=escalated` - Show only escalated reports
- `?status=overdue` - Show only overdue reports

#### **View Logic:**
```python
# Regular leaders see only reports submitted TO them
reports = Report.objects.filter(submitted_to=current_user)

# President and State Supervisor see ALL reports
if is_president or is_state_supervisor:
    reports = Report.objects.all()
```

---

## üîó REPORT CHAIN TRACKING

### **Parent-Child Relationships:**

Each escalated report maintains a link to its parent:

```python
Ward Report (ID: 1)
  ‚Üì parent_report=1
LGA Report (ID: 2)  
  ‚Üì parent_report=2
Zonal Report (ID: 3)
  ‚Üì (Final review, no child)
State Review
```

### **Get Full Chain:**
```python
# From any report, get full chain:
report.get_report_chain()
# Returns: [Ward_Report, LGA_Report, Zonal_Report]
```

---

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION RULES

### **Report Escalation Rules:**

1. **Can Escalate IF:**
   - Status = 'APPROVED'
   - is_escalated = False

## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues:**

#### **Issue 1: Supervisor Not Found**
**Symptom:** Error message "No supervisor found to submit the report to"  
**Cause:** No approved LGA/Zonal/State coordinator exists  
**Solution:** Ensure all coordinator positions are filled with APPROVED users

#### **Issue 2: Notifications Not Sending**
**Symptom:** No emails received  
**Cause:** Email not configured or user has no email  
**Solution:** Check Django email settings, verify user emails

#### **Issue 3: Report Not Escalating**
**Symptom:** APPROVED but not escalated  
**Cause:** State-level report (ZONAL_TO_STATE)  
**Solution:** This is expected - State reports are final

#### **Issue 4: Wrong Supervisor**
**Symptom:** Report goes to wrong person  
**Cause:** User's zone/LGA mismatch  
**Solution:** Verify user's zone/LGA assignments match their jurisdiction
